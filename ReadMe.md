##  Welcome!

My name is Brett, a newly-certified data specialist with a focus on SQL and Python. Below you'll find the projects I've been working on.

### Projects
- [SQL Murder Mystery Solution](https://github.com/BrettRamsay/Data/blob/main/SQLmurder.md): This is a walkthrough and reflection on the SQL queries I used to solve the SQL Murder Mystery.
- [SQL City Analysis and Visualisation Notebook](https://github.com/BrettRamsay/Data/blob/main/SQLCityInvestigation.ipynb): In this project, I used Python to generate data about population, crime, and economic health for the fictitious SQL City. This involved SQL, data analysis, data visualisation, and a small amount of data cleaning. (Full report coming soon)
- Kaggle Data Cleaning Project (Coming soon)

### Skills

- Database: SQLite, SQL Server
